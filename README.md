# Adalight-FastLED

## Synopsis

This project modifies [BlinkyTape](http://blinkinlabs.com/blinkytape/) to support Adalight protocol with [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) ([fastled.io](http://fastled.io)) library. This expands Adalight to, in theory, work with *[any supported FastLED strip](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Chipset-reference)* including WS2812B (aka Adafruit NeoPixels).

In addition to ambilight setups, the protocol can be used to stream *any* color data over serial from a computer to supported LED strips.

For this sketch to work, you'll need to have a copy of the FastLED library. You can download FastLED [from GitHub](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) or through the libraries manager of the Arduino IDE. This program was writen using FastLED 3.1.3 - note that earlier versions of FastLED are untested and may not work properly.

## Basic Setup

Open the LEDstream_FastLED file in the Arduino IDE and customize the settings at the top for your setup. You will need to change:

- Number of LEDs
- LED data pin
- LED type

Upload to your Arduino and use a corresponding PC application to stream color data. You can get [Patrick Siegler's](https://github.com/psieg/) fork of Lightpacks's Prismatik, which you can find [here](https://github.com/psieg/Lightpack/releases).

## Additional Settings

There are additional settings to allow for adjusting:

- Max brightness
- LED color order
- Serial speed
- Serial timeout length

There are also optional settings to clear the LEDs on reset, configure a dedicated ground pin, and to put the Arduino into a "calibration" mode, where all LED colors match the first LED. To help with flickering, the option to flush the serial buffer after every latch is enabled by default.

## Debug Settings

The code includes two debugging options:
- DEBUG_LED
- DEBUG_FPS

`DEBUG_LED` will turn on the Arduino's built-in LED on a successful header match, and off when the LEDs latch. If your LEDs aren't working, this will help confirm that the Arduino is receiving properly formatted serial data.

`DEBUG_FPS`, similarly, will toggle a given pin when the LEDs latch. This is useful for measuring framerate with external hardware, like a logic analyzer.

To enable either of these settings, uncomment their respective '#define' lines.

## Issues and LED-types

I've only tested the code with the WS2812B strips I have on hand, but so far it performs flawlessly. If you find an issue with the code or can confirm that it works with another chipset, please let me know!
